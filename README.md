#Frequently Asked Questions
#####Q: Should I choose email or username in the settings?
######A: This setting needs to match what your DigitalChalk account uses.  If you log into DigitalChalk with an email, select email here, regardless of how you log into WordPress.  Note that if you use email, each WordPress user must have an email address in their profile (although it doesn't have to be their username).  If you are unsure if your DigitalChalk account is set to email or username, contact DigitalChalk support.
